            Demonstrates how to initialize and use the GHI VideoOut Module using plain NETMF, avoiding Gadgeteer entirely.
            This example assumes that a FEZ Cobra II is connected to the VideoOut Module and that 800x600 VGA output is desired.
            See comments if using a different platform or resolution.

            Configures LCD RGB sockets to be compatible with  the GHI VideoOut Module.
            These settings were acquired by first using a Gadgeteer project to initialize the VideoOut Module at a resolution of 800x600 VGA.
            The persistent LCD settings that were automatically set by Gadgeteer was then extracted using GHI's FEZ Config tool, so that 
            they can be reproduced here in plain NETMF. A similar reverse-engineering approach can be used if other resolutions are desired.

            Transmits I2C commands to configure the VideoOut Module for VGA output at 800x600 resolution.
            A Gadgeteer project was created to configure the VideoOut Module for 800x600 VGA output.
            A logic analyzer then snooped on the I2C data being sent to the VideoOut Module as it was being initialized.
            A similar approach can be used to capture the configuration data needed to initialize the VideoOut Module
            if other resolutions or output formats are desired.
